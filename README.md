## DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that can measure temperatures between -55°C and +125°C with the Raspberry Pi, with the input and output linked on the same wire.

## Wiring the Sensor

When you order the DS18B20, it should come with a 4.7K resistor cable. The DS18B20 has three wires: a ground wire (white), the power at 3.3V (red), and the data wire (yellow). Pin assignment depending on the version:

    Red (VCC), Yellow (DATA), Black (GND)
    Red (VCC), White (DATA), Black (GND)
    Red (VCC), Yellow (DATA), White (GND)

## Load the Sensor on Your Raspberry Pi

Now that the sensor is connected, turn on your Raspberry Pi. The first thing to do is to enable the 1-wire interface, which is required to read out the data of the DS18B20. To do this using the Desktop interface, go to Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces > and click Enabled for 1-wire. Alternatively, use the `raspi-config` tool using the terminal. Now reboot your Raspberry Pi (`sudo reboot`).

We will now need to identify the serial number of the sensor, which we enable by adding the 1-Wire and thermometer drivers to the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm
```

To check if the DS18B20 has connected, go to the directory of the 1-Wire devices and list those available:

```bash
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices/
ls
```

You should now see a folder that starts with `28-xxxxxx`. This is the serial number of the sensor. You can read out the raw temperature directly in the terminal by going to the folder `cd 28-xxxxxx` and typing in `cat w1_slave`. The temperature is provided after the `t=` in thousands of a degree.

## Change the Default Pin

If you want to change the default pin from GPIO4 to another pin, you need to modify the `/boot/config.txt` file. Add the following line to the file:

```bash
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=X
```

Replace `X` with the GPIO pin number you want to use. For example, to use GPIO2, you would add:

```bash
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=2
```

After making this change, reboot your Raspberry Pi (`sudo reboot`).

This should cover the basics of connecting and reading from the DS18B20 temperature sensor with your Raspberry Pi. Happy monitoring!
